# JavaScript Exercises - ToDo List

## Day 5 JavaScript Exercises

### Basic Exercises

- [x] **Exercise 1: Creating and Modifying Objects**
  - [x] Create an object `sportsCar` with the following properties:
    - [x] `modelId`: 7
    - [x] `brand`: "SpyMotors"
    - [x] `model`: "Spectre"
    - [x] `colors`: ["Silver", "Black", "White"]
  - [x] Print the `sportsCar` object to the console.
  - [x] Update the `modelId` property of `sportsCar` to 8.
  - [x] Add "Midnight Blue" to the array of colors.
  - [x] Print the updated `sportsCar` object to the console.

- [x] **Exercise 2: Creating Multiple Objects**
  - [x] Create 3 different objects for 3 different themes: 
    - [x] **Car** (e.g., name, brand, model, type, color)
    - [x] **Animal** (e.g., name, type, color, age)
    - [x] **Person** (e.g., firstName, lastName, age, occupation)
  - [x] Each object should have at least one method that shows some of its properties.
  - [x] Print the messages from the methods to the console or browser.

### Intermediate Exercises

- [x] **Exercise 1: Creating Classes**
  - [xx] Extend from the previous exercise and create 3 different classes:
    - [x] **Car Class** with properties like name, brand, model, type, color, and weight.
    - [x] **Animal Class** with properties like name, type, color, and age.
    - [x] **Person Class** with properties like firstName, lastName, age, and occupation.
  - [x] Each class should have at least one method that shows some properties about each theme.
  - [x] Create 3 different objects for each class.
  - [x] Print the messages from the methods to the browser or console.

- [ ] **Exercise 2: Creating Child Classes**
  - [ ] Extend each class with a child class:
    - [ ] **Car** → Create a `Motorbike` child class:
      - [ ] Inherit properties and methods from `Car`.
      - [ ] Add new properties like `numberOfWheels`.
    - [ ] **Animal** → Create a `Fish` child class:
      - [ ] Inherit properties and methods from `Animal`.
      - [ ] Add new properties like `typeOfWater`.
    - [ ] **Person** → Create a `Profession` child class:
      - [ ] Inherit properties and methods from `Person`.
      - [ ] Add new properties like `jobPosition`.
  - [ ] Create 3 different objects for each child class.
  - [ ] Print the results from the methods to the console or browser.

### Challenge

- [ ] **Challenge: Create a Car Shop Website**
  - [ ] Create an array of objects containing data about cars (e.g., car name, production year, image link, price).
  - [ ] Display the data from the array on the `index.html` page using JavaScript loops.
  - [ ] When the user clicks on a car name, display a div with the car image and details.
  - [ ] Implement a feature to hide the car details when clicked again.

### Tips:
- For each task, start by writing small parts of the code, and test it frequently.
- Focus on making sure objects and classes work before adding methods.
- Use `console.log()` and browser alerts (`alert()`) to test your progress.
